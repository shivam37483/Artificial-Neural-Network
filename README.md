# Churn Modeling (Bank-Customers)

This is an artificial neural network-based model with the goal of predicting the likelihood of a new customer leaving the bank, by leveraging a dataset encompassing various customer features from the past six months.
Our aim is to proactively identify potential churners. Subsequently, we can implement targeted strategies, such as offering special incentives, to retain as many customers as possible.
